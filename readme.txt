******Dieter's Web Development Assignment 2******

To view working version :

http://www.deakin.edu.au/~schmidd/SIT203/Assignment2/

This is a template we where given to develop into a functional e-commerce site. 
This Assignment extens functionality using PHP. It's still a beta version and much can be done to
improve the site. However the core functionality is there.

This now features :

1). A working shopping cart, that processes an order.
2). Search functionality. 
3). User registeration.

The backend database is oracle - the DB schema is here :

DBdesign.sql


I have coded the php in the following files :

basket.php
checkout1.php
checkout2.php
checkout3.php
customer-account.php
customer-order.php
customer-orders.php
index.php
logout.php
order.php
order-placed.php
register.php

I have coded all these php files to house all the functions used in the website and perform backend business logic.

cart.php
checkout.php
functions.php
functions-account.php
functions-login.php
global-connect.php
order.php
search.php


All my Javascript to enable search, navigation functions is in :

js/checkout.js ## --> This is a a set of validation Javascript's in Jquery for the order and registration form.
js/search.js   ## --> This is a a set of validation Javascript's in Jquery for the search, navigation field.

*Everything is kept simple so you should not have any problems implementing the template. I will try to answer few of the possible questions below.*



**Changing the colour of the theme**

Every colour variant has its appropriate stylesheets located in the /css directory. To change the colour of the template simply change the path in the header of the HTML template i.e. from *style.default.css* to *style.pink.css*. 

**Modifying template**

For your custom modifications please use custom.css stylesheet. The reason for this is to avoid possible interferences with template updates in the future. 


**Javascript**

Apart from Bootstrap JS components majority of JS is located in /js/front.js. In this file you can change the settings of the carousels, animations etc. 

**Google Maps**

Google maps are used on the contact page. If you need just to show location of the company on the map, the only neccessary thing is to change coordinates in the header of contact.html. For further settings and possibilities please consult [Google Maps API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).

Thank you for downloading!
